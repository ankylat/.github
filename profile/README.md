# Anky: Exploring the Ankyverse

Anky represents a blend of blockchain and AI to reinterpret the age-old narratives, reminding everyone of their distinct place and value. Using open source, we channel the collective might of a community, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together.

## The Ankyverse Explained

In the Ankyverse, time is cyclic:

- **Sojourn**: Lasts 96 winks.
- **Wink**: 24 human hours.
- **The Great Slumber**: A pause of 21 winks after each sojourn.

Each sojourn offers an opportunity to develop a dApp with the potential to improve the world. It's a blend of creation, reflection, and collaboration.

## First Project: The Writing Dementor

Here's a breakdown:

- **Anky (ERC6551 NFT)**: Each user's personal guardian of their digital writings.
  
- **Notebook Templates**: Blueprints created by users. These templates can then be minted into actual notebooks by others.

- **Notebooks (ERC1155 NFTs)**: Collections of prompts crafted by users. They're up for purchase, and each prompt has a suggested response time, facilitating spontaneous, genuine responses.

- **Journals**: Freestyle notebooks available in three sizes: 8, 24, and 96 pages. They offer a space for users to express themselves without constraints on the [anky.lat](https://anky.lat) app.

- **Eulogias**: Community or topic-specific notebooks. They can revolve around art, movies, significant life events, or anything worth discussing. Users can share a link with peers, prompting them to contribute. Once done, they can mint this shared creation, storing it in their Anky.

- **Writing Platform**: All compositions happen on [anky.lat](https://anky.lat), ensuring a permanent imprint in the Ankyverse.

- **Data Archival**: Each written piece points to a permanent URL on Arweave via Bundlr.
