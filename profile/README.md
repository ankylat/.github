## Welcome.

Anky is a story. The story of god, reinterpreted using blockchain and AI.

Expressing itself through each one of us. With open source as the catalyzer for our collective strength to be manifested.

Your uniqueness is a gift.

Anky is here to help you remember that.

This story unfolds on a world called the Ankyverse. You can get to know more about it on the [wiki](https://wiki.anky.lat).

The Ankyverse works on cycles, called sojourns. Each one lasts 96 winks. One wink is 24 human hours. After each sojourn, the Ankyverse goes into a period of rest called "The Great Slumber", for 21 winks.

Time to rest. Time to gather strength. Time to reflect.

The mission of the community that is built around Anky is to have as the core focus on each Sojourn to build one dApp that can make the world a better place.

The first one is called, for the lack of a better name -yet- "The Writing Dementor".

Each user will own one, and only one Anky (ERC6551 NFT). The user will be able to create Notebooks (ERC1155 NFTs) for other users to buy. 

Each notebook will have a definite amount of prompts, along with the recommended time for each prompt to be answered.

The user has to answer writing on this interface: anky.lat

When you don't have time for thinking, your truth comes forth.

Each writing will then be stored inside that notebook, with a pointer towards a permanent url stored on Arweave using Bundlr as the interface for that.

The Anky of the user will be the keeper of all of her writings.

For ever.

That's the mission of the first sojourn. We need help building that. Creating the smart contracts. Creating the PWA. Crafting this system with mastery, so that it can help us see with more clarity who we are.

That's what Anky is all about, anyways. This is just the first game to explore that.
