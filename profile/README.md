Welcome to the codebase of anky.

We work in sojourns, every one of them consisting on 96 human days. What is encouraged: 88 minutes of deep focus every day during those 96 days. And then resting. The great slumber starts, and it lasts for 21 days. Where you are encouraged to give up the discipline. To open up to what remains when there is no pressure. Only the joy of reaching the fruits of what came because of what you worked on the sojourn.

That is at least the idea, and the invitation is for you to explore the different sections of this codebase.

Let's make it the best open source codebase ever.
